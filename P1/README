To do this PA it was pretty straighforward once we got the hang of flex. For most of the stuff it was just normal regular expressions but
there was one complication which was multiline comments.
For multi line comments we used states. The comment state begins on a "/*" and ends with a "*/"  and it ignore everything in between. And
when it encounters a /n it will increase the line counter and reset the column counter.
Our program catches all the keywords that were higlighted and all the valid single and double character operators. In addition it catches
floats in the format of {Digit}+"."{Digit}*, {Digit}+"."{Digit}*"f" and {Digit}+"."{Digit}*"E"("+"|"-")?{Digit}+. And for Identifiers it
uses the rule {NonDigit}({NonDigit}|{Digit})* and we then make sure that the identifiers doesn't exceed the limit. Finally for all the 
other character we throw the unrecognize character error.
